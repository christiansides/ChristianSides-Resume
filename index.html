        <div class="subheading mb-5">Medical ScribeðŸ“š</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">I'm a hardworking individual with background in customer service and quality control. My goal is to gain valuable experience in healthcare, by incorporating my strong work ethics, willingness to learn, and passion for patient care. As for my skills, I'm a strong interpersonal and communication skills, a self-motivated with strong work ethic, have an ability to multitask to meet project deadlines, and a strong team player<br><br>

        As for my work experience, I worked at two seperate jobs. My first job was a warehouse clerk at Lancaster Paris in pasadena, CA from June to September in 2018 and 2019. I performed stocking and sorting of wholesale products and performed quality check for damages. I also organized products and merchandise in preparation for distribution and loaded and unloaded boxes and packages from delivery trucks. In my most recent job I worked as a cashier and busboy at Peteâ€™s Blue Chip Burger in Los Angeles, CA from June 2020 to December 2020.I was responsible for patron payments and handling cash and credit card transactions. I responded and processed food orders by phone and in person and rovided fast, friendly, and quality service to customers. I handled and prepared food for patrons, including packaging take-out orders.I also performed all after hour duties, such as re-stocking food, washing dishes, cleaning counters/tables all while following and ensuring all sanitary, safety and security procedures<br><br>

        Iâ€™d like to bring up my passion and genuine interest, not just into a hospital but in the medical sector in general. Being truly interested in something translates into a level of commitment, and I am confident that my strong desire to work in coordinating the daily administrative activities will help me perform well in the position of medical scribe and get me up to speed quickly. I also have the right educational background to meet the requirements for the medical scribe position. Studying at University of California Riverside (UCR) as a biochemistry major, has been very valuable to me in several key ways. Aside from acquiring the skills and knowledge associated with health care, I have also managed to build a sizable network, and have had the opportunity to participate in community service work, in addition to my academic coursework. There is much to be said for experience and education, but most vital to succeeding at a job are someoneâ€™s personal qualities. I always strive to interact with others in a manner that is authentic and friendly, and I have the ability to communicate clearly and directly. I would also describe myself as empathetic, loyal, and confident. I hope that this brief presentation has given you an idea of who I am, and what I can bring to your hospital. I feel strongly that I would be able to meet your expectations and look forward to being called to an interview so that I might introduce myself further.
